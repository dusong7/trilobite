An ncurses-based filemanager written in C++. Contains super fun features like:
* Colour!
* Cut/Copy files!
* Paste them somewhere else!
* Rename them!
* Delete files you hate!

The main goal of the project is to be fast and lightweight, without a huge amount of dependencies.

Installation
============
Installation is simple, and should only require the ncurses header files (libncurses5-dev on Debian). Then all you need is a simple:

```
make
sudo make install
```

But you already knew that ;)
