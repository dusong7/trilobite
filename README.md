This is for a school project and so all the code has to be my own - as such all pull requests will be ignored until the project is handed in, which will be around Easter 2014.

An ncurses-based filemanager written in C++. Contains super fun features like:
* Colour!
* Cut/Copy files!
* Paste them somewhere else!
* Rename them!
* Delete files you hate!
